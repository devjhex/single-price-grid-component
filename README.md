## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned
I learnt something new from a youtube short that i watched recently that was about the button element. The button element comes with so many properties by default that have to be reset for example padding, font etc. But there is something that I found very helpful and that is the all property with the value of unset.
```css
  button {
    all:unset;
  }
``` 
This is kind of like a shorthand of inherit of all properties of an element so instead of typing all the properties resetting them, this one-line of CSS would do so much better. I thought this is cool.


### Continued development
I want to continue to make sure I get used to all sorts new properties that make life easier in CSS hence also sharing them with others.


### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org) - I would not stop recommending this site because it is great for research most especially how to use certain properties not only in CSS but also JavaScript.
